Embed Text
==========

Embed Text is a library for Go to embed a message in a file. It's originally
designed to embed configuration settings in an already compiled binary, a way
of customizing a binary after it has been compiled.

Check out `cmd/embedtext/main.go` for an example of how to use this.
